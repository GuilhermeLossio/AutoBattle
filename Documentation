1.	Before anything i tryed to run the Project on Visual Studio, but he didn’t build for the Copilation Errors,
At Character.h, there not the namespace.
2.	There some wrong uses of the namespace, like don’t use the namespace std, and use “std::” in some parts that it already include.
3.	The event of the player being to add the player, enemy and started the game was add to BattleField::Setup
4.	I removed the switch case for function CreatePlayerCharacter().
5.	I puted a switch case on BattleField::CreatePlayerCharacter to show the character chosen by the player. (I also increased the damage to 30)
6.	I found some erros made that didn’t used make_shared to make a instance.
I decressed the enemy atk too.
7.	I made some changes at grid files, and fixed some erros.
Latter i going to take a time for fix the enemy function.
8.	I add the code to verify if the player is dead or the enemy is dead. Basically when Die() is called, if the player isn’t dead, the enemy will be. I also putted the
operation to reduce the health from the attacked target and changed the TakeDamage from bool to void.
9.	I made the character detection and movement for player and enemy. Also fixed more some problems with the grid. Still having some problems with the EnemyCharacter.
10.	As final touches I fixed the problem that was occurring with the enemies and the Grid, which did not appear.
11.	Later i found a method to make the player's position random.
